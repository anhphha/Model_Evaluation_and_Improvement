# Model_Evaluation_and_Improvement

Arcada UAS | Project: Model evaluation and improvement | Tools: Python | Project is about to evaluate and improve the machine learning model

- Preprocessed data (ETL) and encoded data labels before analytics
- Found the best parameters on the validation set by using GridSearch
- Created a complete pipeline to find the best two models (GridSearchCV, SVM) in which one model predicted the morphologic pattern and the other the fetal state
